read from this link. 

What inspired me was how bhagavad geeta is both milk and honey at the same time (krishna the milker milking a cow called geeta), and 
how parijata is mahabharata of vedavyasa milking his heart. and honey of parijata is the geeta. Jai Sri krishna! 

I will experiment and update this page daily of my observations. No I thing my body talks better to me, and my height has grown.
